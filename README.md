# Project - MoneyCooks

> **Developed by Yash Kawade**

## Idea

This project--MoneyCooks--is a financial literacy application
developed for Android for users at Pace University to learn about 
and budget their finances in regards to various areas, such as
price comparison of food, deals and sales, investment and
scam information.

## Design

The user interface of this application will include a GridLayout 
in the main screen that will allow the user to select 
an item and redirect the user to an activity regarding that item. 

> Ex. If a user selects "Price Comparison", they will be 
redirected to another activity that allows them to 
compare food and item prices. If a user selects "Scams", 
the user will be redirected to yet another activity that 
allows them to view information on scams.

The user additionally will be able to return back to the main 
activity by clicking back on their phone or device at the very
bottom (or top depending on device).

The beauty of this design lies in its very simple, yet eloquent 
design that provides the user with the sense that they are able 
to do many things within the application at first glance. With 
a fancy GridLayout with a different CardViews, the user 
automatically sees many options at their disposal. This app
is user friendly for anyone of any age!

Lastly, we will fit this design with a smooth pastel colored 
background with transparent images and the app icon (the Money Cook).

## Functions

### Budgeting

A screen of the application will display user's financial information and help 
them track their expenses and income. The screen will consist of several sections, 
including a dashboard that provides an overview of the user's financial status, 
such as their current balance and monthly spending patterns.

The application may allow users to create and manage different budgets, 
such as monthly, weekly, or annual budgets. The user can set goals and 
targets for their spending and the app can provide alerts when they are 
close to exceeding their budget. The budgeting application may also provide 
visual representations of the user's spending habits, to help them better 
understand their financial patterns.

Additionally, the budgeting application screen features transaction lists 
that display all the user's expenses and income, categorized by type. 
The user can also add new transactions manually and assign them to specific categories.

Overall, a budgeting application screen is designed to provide users 
with a clear and concise view of their financial situation, helping them make 
informed decisions about their spending and saving habits.

### Price Comparison

Because prices of items and food varies from different stores 
as compared to Pace University's own cafeteria, the user 
will be able to compare prices as well as value for price, 
and the program will determine the best item for the best 
price based on priority.

This function additionally provides the user with the option
to see a full list of items that are available in general,
with the app determing whether or not they exist in each
respective store when they search for said item.

### Scams

A scam is a social engineering attack designed to persuade 
or coerce an unwilling party into relinquishing sensitive 
information (such as bank account information or passwords) 
in order to obtain access to data or money. The same can be 
said for someone who is experiencing food insecurity, and scams 
can attract the individual to relinquish details using special 
deals on legit food consumer platforms and websites.

The section of scams will contain a list of common scams and
social engineering techniques and how to avoid them. Additionally,
this informational section will provide guidance on how to remain
cautious when dealing with food insecurity so scams do not easily
trick unsuspecting yet vulnerable users.

### Info

Shows a page where the user can see all the functions they are able to do
with the app, as well as information on what they do.
